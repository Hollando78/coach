# Reserve ports for this project
make reserve-ports

# Find available ports
python3 /root/project/portman.py find --start 3000

- Backend: 3001
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- Redis: 6379

### Environment Variables

Copy and customize the example files:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

Key backend variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://coach:coach123@localhost:5432/coach
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-minimum-32-characters-long!
REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-minimum-32-characters-long!
COOKIE_SECRET=your-super-secret-cookie-key-minimum-32-characters-long!
```

## Database Schema

### Core Entities
- **Users & Auth**: User, Session
- **Teams & Players**: Team, Player
- **Seasons & Matches**: Season, Match
- **Planning & Events**: Formation, MatchPlan, Block, Assignment, Substitution, Goal

### Key Relationships
- Users own Teams
- Teams have Players and Seasons
- Seasons contain Matches
- Matches have Plans, Assignments, and Events

### WebSocket Events
```
# Client to Server
match:join              # Join match room
match:leave             # Leave match room
match:update            # Update match state
substitution:make       # Record substitution
goal:score             # Record goal

# Server to Client
match:started          # Match started
match:stopped          # Match stopped
match:updated          # State updated
substitution:made      # Substitution confirmed
goal:scored           # Goal confirmed
timer:tick            # Match timer update
```

## Offline Support

The app works offline using:
- **Service Worker**: Caches static assets and API responses
- **IndexedDB**: Stores matches, teams, and offline events
- **Event Queue**: Queues actions when offline, syncs when online
- **Background Sync**: Automatic sync when connection restored

## Performance Targets

- API response time: < 200ms
- Page load time: < 3s on 3G
- Real-time latency: < 100ms
- Database queries: < 50ms
- Concurrent users: 100+ per match
- Uptime target: 99.9%

## Security

- **Authentication**: Lucia Auth with secure sessions
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all inputs
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries via Prisma
- **CORS**: Strict origin policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
# Check what's using ports
make ports
# Free up conflicting ports
python3 /root/project/portman.py free 3001
```

**Database connection:**
```bash
# Reset database
make db-reset
# Check database health
docker-compose exec db pg_isready -U coach
```

**Build issues:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make install
make build
```

**Docker issues:**
```bash
# Clean Docker resources
make docker-clean
# Rebuild images
make docker-build
```

### Development Tips

1. **Use the port manager** - Always check port availability before starting services
2. **Monitor logs** - Use `make logs` to see real-time application logs
3. **Health checks** - Run `make health` to verify all services are running
4. **Clean state** - Use `make dev-refresh` for a complete reset

## Contributing

2. Create feature branch
3. Run tests: `make test`
4. Check types: `make typecheck`
5. Lint code: `make lint`
